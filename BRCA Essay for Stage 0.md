**Introduction**  
BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) that help to prevent uncontrolled cell growth and promote DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint activation. Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 have been demonstrated to increase the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer **\[1, 2\]**.  
**Structure and Function of BRCA1 and BRCA2**  
**BRCA1** is located on chromosome 17 (17q21)  and it has 24 exons. It codes for a protein consisting of 1863 amino acids (5.6Kb) while **BRCA2** is located on chromosome 13 (13q12) and consists of 27 exons. It codes for a protein consisting of 3418 amino acids (10.2Kb).  
BRCA genes belong to a group of DNA repair genes that carry out regulatory functions in the cell cycle, coding for proteins involved in the response to DNA damage **\[3\]**. They also play an important role in transcriptional regulation, cell growth control, and genomic stability **\[4\]**.  
**Incidence and role of BRCA genes in cancers**  
Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes account for about 20% of familial breast and ovarian cancers **\[5, 6\]**. In addition to breast and ovarian cancer in women, mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes predispose to other cancer types like male breast cancer and prostate cancer. Also,  BRCA1 mutation carriers may be at high risk for the development of colon, rectal and pancreatic cancer as well as stomach cancer **\[7, 8, 9\]**.  
Alterations in BRCA genes leading to cancer are the result of an inactivating mutation (a mutation that compromises function). The inability of the BRCA gene to play its role in the DNA repair mechanism results in the accumulation of harmful mutations, eventually leading to cancer.  
**Testing for BRCA Mutations**   
The standard method for testing BRCA genes includes comprehensive sequencing and testing of broad rearrangements **\[10, 11\]**. Next-generation sequencing systems allow for quick and accurate evaluation of millions of gene sequences at once  **\[3\]**.  
**Treatment options for patients with BRCA mutations**  
Treatment options for cancer patients with BRCA mutations vary and are typically determined by a number of factors evaluated by the clinician. Common treatment options include radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, etc **\[12\].** Preventive procedures such as mastectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy have proven beneficial for the reduction of the risk of breast and ovarian cancer development **\[13, 14\].**  
**Conclusion**  
It is estimated that about 13% of women will experience breast cancer in their lifetime” **\[15\]**. Therefore understanding BRCA1 and BRCA2 and their mutations is highly critical. With the knowledge gathered from continuous research and the ever-increasing advancements in genetic testing and personalized medicine, individuals with harmful alterations in the BRCA genes can manage their cancer risk and also improve prognosis and survival rate.
